# Datails for Data:
Pymaceuticals Inc.specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. They are screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. 

Data is analyzed to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this following is done:

* A Scatter plot is created that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* A Scatter plot is created that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* A Scatter plot is created that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* A bar graph is created that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
